Script to Processing Noise Data from ANP Database (Aircraft Noise and
Performance)  
======
This script is a processor of datas from ANP Database, using NPD data (Noise
Power Distance), to extract values of EPNL, LAmax, SEL and calculate values of
LAmax in segment with lateral directivity and lateral attenuation. The aircraft chosen
to extract and processing data is Boeing 737.

To run the script open the MATLAB, enter in folder project and run the script
like this on MATLAB terminal:
```
>>  main_processing
